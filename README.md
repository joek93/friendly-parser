# friendly-parser
Simple (user-)friendly command line parser for C++. 

## usage
An example of usage can be found in 'example_parsing.cpp'.
Just compile it using `make`.

## notes on the implementation
The code is based on template programming and the std::variant class (C++17).
I am still a noob on metaprogramming, so the implementation is very raw and it can definitely be improved, but it works nicely for my original purposes.
